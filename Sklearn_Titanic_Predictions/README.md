# Titanic Survival Predictions with Sklearn

This directory contains a comprehensive Jupyter Notebook titled `Titanic_Survival_Predictions_with_Sklearn.ipynb`. The notebook is dedicated to demonstrating and teaching the application of various `sklearn` techniques and models to predict survival on the Titanic. The problems are crafted to guide you through the process of data preprocessing, model creation, and model tuning using the `sklearn` library.

## Notebook Overview

The notebook is structured to sequentially build up your understanding and application of `sklearn` methods. It starts with basic data preprocessing and gradually moves to more complex model creation and hyperparameter tuning. Key areas covered include:

- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting data into training and test sets.
- Model Creation: Building a custom multi-class classification model named `BasicLinearClassifier`.
- Model Tuning and Evaluation: Implementing a `sklearn` pipeline and performing GridSearch to find the best model parameters.

## Getting Started

To interact with the notebook and explore the solutions:

1. Ensure you have Python and Jupyter installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the `Sklearn_Titanic_Predictions` directory within the cloned repository.
4. Launch Jupyter Notebook and open the `Titanic_Survival_Predictions_with_Sklearn.ipynb` file.
