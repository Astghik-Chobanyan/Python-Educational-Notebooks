# Python Educational Notebooks

Welcome to the `Python Educational Notebooks` repository! This repository is a comprehensive collection of Jupyter Notebooks designed to offer hands-on experience and in-depth knowledge across various domains using Python. It serves as an educational resource for learning and applying Python in real-world scenarios, ranging from data manipulation and analysis to predictive modeling with libraries like `numpy`, `pandas`,`sklearn`.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into several directories, each focusing on a specific theme or dataset. Below is an overview of the directories and their contents:

1. **Numpy_Array_Challenges**
   - **Notebook**: `Numpy_Challenges.ipynb`
   - **Focus**: Engaging and solving challenges related to array manipulations and operations using NumPy.

2. **Data_Analysis_with_Pandas**
   - **Notebook**: `Pandas_Data_Manipulation_Iris_Titanic.ipynb`
   - **Focus**: In-depth data analysis and manipulation on Iris and Titanic datasets using Pandas.

3. **Sklearn_Titanic_Predictions**
   - **Notebook**: `Titanic_Survival_Predictions_with_Sklearn.ipynb`
   - **Focus**: Predictive modeling on the Titanic dataset using `sklearn`, showcasing data preprocessing, model creation, and tuning.

4. **Kahoot_Quiz_Analytics**
   - **Notebook**: `Kahoot_Data_Analysis_and_Predictions.ipynb`
   - **Focus**: Data analysis and predictive modeling on Kahoot quiz data, focusing on understanding student performance and predicting quiz outcomes.

5. **Student_Performance_Predictor**
