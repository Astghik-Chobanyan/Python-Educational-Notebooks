# Data Analysis with Pandas: Iris and Titanic Datasets

Welcome to the `Data_Analysis_with_Pandas` repository. This section contains a comprehensive Jupyter Notebook titled `Pandas_Data_Manipulation.ipynb`, which is an in-depth exploration and solution guide to a series of problems focusing on data manipulations using the Pandas library. The problems are divided into two parts: the first part deals with the Iris dataset, and the second part delves into the Titanic dataset.

## Overview of the Notebook

The notebook is structured as follows:

### Part 1: Iris Dataset Manipulations
- Problems in this section involve creating and manipulating a DataFrame for the Iris dataset.
- Functions are designed to perform tasks such as creating a structured DataFrame, performing group-based statistics, and filtering data based on certain criteria.

### Part 2: Titanic Dataset Manipulations
- This section addresses data cleaning, transformation, and analysis tasks related to the Titanic dataset.
- Functions in this section handle tasks such as extracting specific passenger data, filling missing values, and calculating statistical data from the dataset.

## Getting Started

To interact with the notebook and explore the solutions:

1. Ensure you have Python and Jupyter installed on your system.
2. Clone the `Data_Analysis_with_Pandas` repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the `Data_Analysis_with_Pandas` directory within the cloned repository.
4. Launch Jupyter Notebook and open the `Pandas_Data_Manipulation.ipynb` file.
