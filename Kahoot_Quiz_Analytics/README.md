# Kahoot Quiz Analytics and Predictions

This directory contains a comprehensive Jupyter Notebook titled `Kahoot_Data_Analysis_and_Predictions.ipynb`. The notebook is a deep dive into data analysis and predictive modeling using the Kahoot platform's quiz data. The focus is on understanding the patterns and performances of students across various quizzes and predicting outcomes based on the insights gathered.

## Notebook Overview

The notebook is structured to provide a thorough analysis of Kahoot quiz data and build predictive models based on the data. It starts with data consolidation and preprocessing and gradually moves to more complex data manipulations, analytics, and predictive modeling. Key areas covered include:

- Data Consolidation: Combining data from multiple quizzes and aligning them for analysis.
- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and creating new insightful features.
- Data Analysis: Analyzing quiz performance, speed, and correctness of answers across different student demographics.
- Predictive Modeling: Building a model to predict the probability of a student answering a question correctly based on their historical performance and question difficulty.
