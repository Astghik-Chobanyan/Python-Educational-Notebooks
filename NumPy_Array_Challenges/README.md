# Python Educational Notebooks: Advanced Array Manipulations

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook titled `Numpy_Challenges.ipynb`, which is a comprehensive guide through a series of array manipulation problems using NumPy in Python. Each section in the notebook is dedicated to solving a specific problem, making it a valuable resource for learning and reference.

## Overview of Problems in the Notebook

The notebook contains solutions for the following problems:

1. **Euclidean Distance**
   - Calculate the Euclidean distance between two arrays.

2. **Rescale Array**
   - Rescale an array so that the values are between 0 and 1.

3. **Find Missing Values**
   - Return the positions of missing values in a one-dimensional numpy array as a list.

4. **Fill Missing Values**
   - Replace missing elements in a 2D numpy array with the column mean, min, or max based on a specified mode.

5. **Array Encoding**
   - Convert a one-dimensional array into a two-dimensional encoded array, marking the presence of elements with 1s.

6. **Array Padding**
   - Add additional rows and columns of zeros around a 2D array.

7. **Matrix Calculations**
   - Perform complex matrix calculations involving eigenvalues and matrix inverse (or pseudo-inverse).

8. **Sum Range Filtering**
   - Filter rows of a 2D array based on the sum of their elements being within a specified range.

9. **Euclidean Distance (Broadcasting)**
   - Calculate the Euclidean distances between row vectors of a 2D array and a 1D array efficiently using broadcasting.

10. **Convolution Operations**
    - Apply convolution operations on 2D arrays using a specified function `f`.

## Getting Started

To interact with the notebook and explore the solutions:

1. Ensure you have Python and Jupyter installed on your system.
2. Clone the Python Educational Notebooks repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the `Numpy_Array_Challenges` directory within the cloned repository.
4. Launch Jupyter Notebook and open the `Numpy_Challenges.ipynb` file.

## Usage

The notebook is designed to be user-friendly and interactive:

- Each problem is presented with a clear description and its objective.
- You can run code cells individually to understand each part of the solution process.
